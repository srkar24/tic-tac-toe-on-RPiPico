**Tic Tac Toe on Raspberry Pi Pico**

This project implements a two-player Tic Tac Toe game on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The game uses GPIO buttons for player inputs and LEDs to indicate player turns and game status. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules. A demo video has been pushed to showcase the project.

Hardware used: RPi Pico, a breadboard; a red, a green LED; two 330 Î© resistors and jumper wires.

Software used: GNU Arm Embedded toolchain, Mingw-w64 for Windows native builds, CMake, Visual Studio Code.
